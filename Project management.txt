Project 
* A temporary endeavour that has a specific and unique goal and usually has a budget 
* Has a definite beginning and end
* Needs to have a clearly defined goal and what your trying to accomplish
* It has a definite start and end point
* Once the end point is reached, the project is over
* It is attempting to achieve something new
* Project must meet the customer or stakeholder requirement


What is project management
* Like answering a few questions 
* What problem are you solving/what are you trying to do
* How are you going to solve the issue (solutions)
* Whats your plan (plan)
* designed to assist managers in accomplishing definite goals by carefully organizing, controlling, and executing the project
* challenge of software project management is to achieve project goals while keeping in mind the project scope, time, quality, and cost
* Handles integration, cost, hr, stakeholder management, scope, quality, communications, procurement, risk management 


Objectives
* How does the project fit into the organization?
* How will the project evolve over time?
* What skills are required to manage the project successfully?
* Development and Implementation of procedures
* Efficient communication, collaboration, and productive guidelines
* Achieve project goals within the estimated time with high quality
* Allocate and optimize necessary resources to meet project goals
* Meet the exclusive needs and requirements of the client


 Project Management Lifecycle process is divided into four main parts
* Project Management Life Cycle is a series of essential activities for accomplishing project objectives or targets
* a framework that includes the stages to transform an idea into reality
*  Projects may have different dimensions and difficulty levels, but they can be mapped to the Project Management life cycle structure, whatever the project’s size is
  



 Initiation Stage
* Develop a Project Charter and
* Identify Stakeholders


Project charter
* Document that allows a pm to utilize resources for the sake of the project to create a project charter
* the inputs required will be enterprise environment factor, business case, agreements, a project statement of work and organizational process assets 
* Project goals
* Project constraints and Problem statements
* Assign project manager
* Stakeholder list
* High-level schedule and budget
* Milestones
* Approvals


Planning stage 
* Identifying Stakeholders
* stakeholder can influence the success and failure of the project
* To note down the information about the stakeholder, a Stakeholder Register is used
* the stakeholder register will have information like:Type of stakeholder, Expectation of stakeholder, Role in Project ( Business Analyst, Tech architect, Client PM), Designation (Director, Business Lead, etc.), Type Communication ( Weekly/Monthly), Influence on the project ( Partial/Supportive/Influensive)


Develop project plan 
* Project Planning phase covers about 50% of the whole process
* Planning phase determines the scope of the project as well as the objective of the project
* It begins with the outputs of initiation phase (charter, preliminary scope statement, and project manager)
* The output of the planning phase serves as the input for the execution phase
* important aspects of planning process are the planning phase should not be executed before your initial planning is finished
* Until the execution process does not start, you should not stop revising plans
* Who is going to do the work
* Estimated time 
* Estimated cost
* Use over the course of the project
* Directs peoples tasks 
* Tracks projects progression 
* Aids in course correction
* Communicates progress with stakeholders 


Work breakdown structure (wbs)
* Easier to estimate time and cost 
* Easier to assign work
* conduct a brainstorm to list all the tasks
* Involve your whole team for brainstorming
* Write down the structure tree of the task also known as WBS (work breakdown structure)
* Further breakdown your top WBS into a hierarchical set of activities, for instance, categories, sub-categories
* Define how to record the items into your WBS
* Ask other people: can be an expert, experienced personnel
* Granularity: how detailed your task should you have
* Estimating cost and time for higher granularity is hard while for lower granularity it will be bogged down with too detailed information
* Granularity should be of right level not too high or not too low


Creating wbs 
* Breaking disown tasks
* Break down into 8 to 80 hour taks 
* Match to frequency of status report
* Brainstorm with team to build wbs 
* Conduct a brainstorm to list all the tasks
* Involve your whole team for brainstorming
* Write down the structure tree of the task also known as WBS (work breakdown structure)
* Further breakdown your top WBS into a hierarchical set of activities, for instance, categories, sub-categories, etc. For example hardware, software, trainee, management teams, etc.
* Define how to record the items into your WBS
* Ask other people – it can be an expert, experienced personnel, etc.
* Granularity- how detailed your task should you have? Estimating cost and time for higher granularity is hard while for lower granularity it will be bogged down with too detailed information
* Granularity should be of right level not too high or not too low




Defining activities 
* the procedure for documenting and identifying specific actions to be performed to produce the project deliverables
* each work package is broken down into individual work schedule activities
* Schedule management plan
* Scope baseline
* Enterprise environmental factors
* Organizational process assets


Sequence activities 
* logically organizing defines activities 
* It determines the order in which the activities need to be performed


Estimating Activity Resources
* the process of estimating the work effort and resources required to complete the task 
* The other factor that has to be considered at this stage is the availability of the resources
* Estimate resources for: Critical tasks, Floating tasks
* Schedule Management Plan
* Activity list
* Resource Calendar
* Enterprise environmental factors
* Organizational process assets


Estimating activity durations 
* the process of estimating the number of work periods (weeks/months) required to complete the individual task with estimated resources
* cannot calculate activity duration without calculating the work effort and resources required to complete the task


Develop schedule
* the process of analyzing activity sequences, resource requirements, durations and schedule constraints to create the project schedule model
* three main factors are taken into consideration: Duration, Task dependencies, Constraints
* Can be things like project schedule, project network diagram, milestone chart, documentation

Traditional monet lifcyle (waterfall) 
* Have 5 stages or phases 
* Initiate: define project, asses scope: resources needed, stakeholders, ask for approval
* Plan: what are we going to do: how are we going to do it: how will we know when its done
* Execution 
* Manage and control: check progress, compare what's planned, occurs through most of project lifecylce
* Close: client to approve and accept project is complete, Document performance 
* Lesions learned 
* Close contracts 
*  Help resources more to next assignment
* Works well when goals are clearly defined 
* Simple 
* Low risk 
* Familiar technology
* Experienced resources

Project Management Methodologies
* Prince2
* Agile
* Six Sigma
* Scrum
* Kanban
* Lean
* Waterfall


Waterfall Model:
Waterfall model is based on the incremental model. In this method, the project is planned from top to bottom at once. The whole project will be divided into seven consecutive phases. In this method, all the features are delivered at once at the end of the cycle


Agile:
In this method the process design is broken into individual models. The development process is iterative, and the end of each iteration, shippable features of the product are delivered to the customer


PRINCE 2:
It is a general project management methodology and can be used for a project of any scale. It is a process-oriented approach with each process having inputs and outputs, tasks and activities to complete
RAD:
Rapid application development is a project management methodology used for software development, where the main purpose of developing application faster with high quality. The whole development process is defined into four phase


Kanban:
In Kanban methods, a board is used on which sticky notes are placed in the column as per the status of the task. The common status used for project task include “in queue”, “in progress” and “recently completed.”


Six Sigma:
The six sigma are preferred for a project that needs precise measure. It uses the statistics to improve processes and minimize defects in a product or service. It uses two different sets of methodologies DMAIC and DMADV


SDLC:
SDLC (System Development Life Cycle) is a generic approach to project management which cover basic project management concepts like needs analysis, design, training, delivery, and support


Extreme Programming (XP):
XP is frequently used for IT project management. Like scrum, XP also works in iteration but their iteration duration is usually short. The scope within each iteration is flexible as long as the work is not started


Crystal Methodology:
This method is quite supportive for fixed price contracts. Iterations in crystal method are released regularly. This method can detect any flaws in the early stage of the project, and errors are less likely to occur.


CCPM (Critical Chain Project Management):
This method reduce activity duration time by 50% hence project can be finished early. It uses buffer management to control the plan and ensures minimum error.




Some tools work better for waterfall vs agile

* Dont have to be perfect off the bat 
* Top down estimate: estimate phpases or major compnnets and break them into smaller pisces unti lyou get individual tasks
* Bottom up: srtimate each tsks then add them up unt il you have the estimate for the entire project
* Parametric estimating: Past data or record is used to estimate cost for the current project
* Analogous Estimating: based on expert judgments and information based on similar previous projects
* Want to pick between the shortest or best amount of time and the worst or longest amount of time
* Choose the estimate with an acceptable orbablility of success
Budget planning 
* allocate and authorize the monetary resources required to complete the project
*  determining the budget includes cost performance baseline
* this stage explains the process of estimating the work effort and resources required to complete the task
* A realistic estimate 
* Cost to complete projectLabout coast is usually the biggest part (bruned costs, salrys , benefits)
* Time-based resources
* Locations or equipment 
* Material cost, consumable good
* Ancillary, travel, training, fees
