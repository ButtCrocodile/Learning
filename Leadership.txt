Read the room, remember we are human: This point emphasizes the importance of being attentive to the dynamics and mood of the team. Recognizing the human aspect in the workplace allows you to connect with your team on a deeper level and adjust your approach accordingly.


Confront reality and share what you see: Acknowledging and addressing the reality of a situation is essential for effective leadership. By sharing your observations and insights, you promote transparency and create opportunities for problem-solving and growth.

Motivation: Understanding the science of motivation can guide your approach to inspiring and engaging your team. Pay attention to intrinsic motivators such as purpose, mastery, and autonomy, which drive individuals to excel and find satisfaction in their work.

Consider both internal fairness (equal pay for equal work within your organization) and external fairness (comparing salaries with industry standards). Aim to provide compensation that meets employees' needs and ensures financial stability.


Purpose, mastery, and autonomy: These three key motivators play a significant role in driving employee engagement. A leader's responsibility is to create an environment that offers a sense of purpose, opportunities for mastery and growth, and autonomy in decision-making and task execution.

Reinforce these changes consistently and lead with a purposeful vision that inspires your team to create a positive impact.
