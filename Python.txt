About python
* A programming language 
* Gives us a way to communicate ideas
* The ideas are commands when it comes to programming


Comments
* How we tell the program to ignore things 
* Can also be used to comment about what we are doing in a program
  





VARIABLES
* How we store info
* Can be static or dynamic
* Saves in memory




Strings 
* You store it in a variable[a] 
* A string of text
* Dont need a keyword to declare a variable
* Use the + operator to add strings
* Use curly brackets to format string[b]
*     



Modifying strings 
   * Change what the string does depending on what you ask it to do
  



Taking some input 
   * Use the input function to take in input 


Numeric data types
   * Stores in a variable 
   * Integers are whole numbers 
   * Floating point are decimal numbers 


My_int = 7
Print(my_int(


My_flt = 3.7
Print(my_flt)


boolean 
   * True or false values






User input 
   * A way to allow someone to add something in a prompt 
   * input()
   * Be careful with input stuff, by default python converts things into a string
   * Use int function to convert functions into integers, use something similar depending on what your doing with the numbers
  





Lists 
   * Useful for large amounts of data 
   * A way to manage and store it 
   * Use square brackets
   * Can use ints, boolean and more
  



Prints everything in the list


  



Use indexes to print out or reference a specific item in the list
   * Runs from 0 on
  

Can also reference items backwards
  



How you can change a list
   *   





Some functions in a list 
   
  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  





Tuples 
      * A type of data structure 
      * A container to store different stuff
      * Use open and closed parenthesis for a tuple
      * Are immutable [c]
  



Functions 
      * A collection of code that performed specific task
      * Use a keyword to create function 
      * Use def function
      * Need to be indented
      * Best to break code into different function
  

  

  





Abs function 
      * Gives absolute value of something
      * abs()
Pow function 
      * Calculates the exponential of a number
Len function 
      * Returns the length[d]  if an object
      * len()
Max function 
      * Returns the max value from a sequence
      * max()
Min function 
      * Returns the minimum value from a sequence 
      * min()
Sum function 
      * Returns the sum of all elements
      * sum()
Round function 
      * Rounds a number to a specified number of decimals
      * round()
Return statement
      * A way to get info back from a function
      *   If statements 
         * A structure to make a decision 
         *     



  



  



If statements and comparisons 
            * A way to compare values
  



Dictionaries 
            * A special structure in python that allows to store info in something called key value pairs 
            * The word is the key
            * The value is the definition
            * Can also use numbers
  





White loop 
            * Allows us to go through a block of code multiple times 
            * Keep going through loop until something is false
  



For loop 
            * Allows us to loop over different collections of items
            * Loop through strings, arrays, numbers 
            * Have a specific purpose
  



  





  



  



Exponent function 
  



Exponent function in a loop 


  





2d lists 
            * Making lists if a list
  



nested loops
            *   

try/except
               * Ways to handle/manage errors
               *  A sort of way to add some code to “try”/test code and prints out errors


  

Reading files 
               * Reading from external files 
               * Use the read command
  



Writing and appending to files 
               *   

Modules and pip
                  * A file that we can import into our current python file 
                  * Has things like variables and functions
                  * Use import  function 
                  * Things like pygame, pyglet, python arcade academy and more are useful for game development
Classes and objects 
                  * Useful for making things more organized and powerful 
                  * Creating our own data type
  



Object functions 
                  *   

inheritance 
                     * An oop concept that allows you to create a new class based on an exshoting class
                     * The new class inherits the attributes and behavours of the existing class
